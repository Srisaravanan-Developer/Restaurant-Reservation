 The Restaurant manager is a very busy person and does not have the time to sit 
and manage the entire activities manually on paper. This application gives him the power and flexibility to 
manage the entire system from a single online system. Hotel management project provides room booking, staff 
management and other necessary hotel management features. The system allows the manager to post available 
rooms in the system. Customers can view and book room online. Admin has the power of either approving or 
disapproving the customerâ€™s booking request. Other hotel services can also be viewed by the customers and can 
book them too. The system is hence useful for both customers and managers to portable manage the hotel 
activities. One of the most attractive advantages of creating web application is the cost factor. Web development 
services required to execute this is way cheaper than other kinds of web developments. It simply consists of 
creating links between the URL and the application, and since that is relatively simpler to do, it takes far less time 
for development. Thus, making it overall a cost-effective affair for the owner. Ease of customization also helps 
here. Since many developers find it less complicated to customize web apps by easily changing the interface of 
the app, operations can be done with less time and effort, resulting in spending fewer resource.
